#Proposal

[As a ballpark number, your proposal should contain about 3-4 pages of text plus 5-6 pages of sketches. Your sketches can be made by computer, but it will probably be easier to brainstorm with your team members using pen and paper and then taking a picture and uploading it to your proposal.]

##Background and Motivation

For the average person, the economy is hard to understand. It is trusted little and liked less. The economy is a powerful force in our nation, community, and daily life, and we believe an enhanced understanding of economic indicators and history will inform the general population and assuage fear of the unknown. 

While data visualization will not prevent the next recession, it can shed light on why current events are happening and what the future may bring. Economic indicators such as an inverted yield curve and declines in business investment lead business cycles and show that we may be headed into another recession right now. If so, the damage would reach far beyond the borders of the United States, and global recovery may take longer than we think.

We believe this information can and should be presented in ways that are easy to understand, even for those who are not trained economists. As dual majors in Economics and Computer Science, we know from experience that learning about the economy can lead us to care more and fear less. Our economics coursework has taught us how to understand the data we will visualize in this project and has inspired us to share the understanding we ourselves have gained.

##Project Objectives
Primary questions we would like to answer with our visualization:

- How quickly and strongly are countries around the globe affected when the one country enters a recession?  
- How long does it take for these countries to recover relative to the country that triggered the recession?
- What economic indicators are correlated with recessions in the United States?
- What economic indicators show that we may be headed into a recession?
- Where are these indicators at right now?
- When have recessions happened in the past and how severe were they?

Benefits:

- Develop a general understanding of how recessions happen based on economic indicators
- Learn when recessions have happened in the past century and how severe they were
- Show the current state of the United States economy
- Understand the links between national and global economies
- Build compassion for other countries who have recessions triggered by the United States

[Provide the primary questions you are trying to answer with your visualization. What would you like to learn and accomplish? List the benefits.]

##Data
[From where and how are you collecting your data? If appropriate, provide a link to your data sources.]

##Data Processing
[Do you expect to do substantial data cleanup? What quantities do you plan to derive from your data? How will data processing be implemented?]

##Visualization Design
[How will you display your data? Provide some general ideas that you have for the visualization design. Develop three alternative prototype designs for your visualization. Create one final design that incorporates the best of your three designs. Describe your designs and justify your choices of visual encodings. We recommend you use the [Five Design Sheet Methodology](http://fds.design/).]

##Must-Have Features

- [List the features without which you would consider your project to be a failure.]
-


##Optional Features

- [List the features which you consider to be nice to have, but not critical.]
-


##Project Schedule
[Make sure that you plan your work so that you can avoid a big rush right before the final project deadline, and delegate different modules and responsibilities among your team members. Write this in terms of weekly deadlines.]
