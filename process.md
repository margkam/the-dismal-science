#Proposal

[As a ballpark number, your proposal should contain about 3-4 pages of text plus 5-6 pages of sketches. Your sketches can be made by computer, but it will probably be easier to brainstorm with your team members using pen and paper and then taking a picture and uploading it to your proposal.]

##Basic Info
[The project title, your names, e-mail addresses, UIDs, a link to the project repository.]

##Background and Motivation

[Discuss your motivations and reasons for choosing this project, especially any background or research interests that may have influenced your decision.
Project Objectives. Provide the primary questions you are trying to answer with your visualization. What would you like to learn and accomplish? List the benefits.]

##Data
[From where and how are you collecting your data? If appropriate, provide a link to your data sources.]

##Data Processing
[Do you expect to do substantial data cleanup? What quantities do you plan to derive from your data? How will data processing be implemented?]

##Visualization Design
[How will you display your data? Provide some general ideas that you have for the visualization design. Develop three alternative prototype designs for your visualization. Create one final design that incorporates the best of your three designs. Describe your designs and justify your choices of visual encodings. We recommend you use the [Five Design Sheet Methodology](http://fds.design/).]

##Must-Have Features

- [List the features without which you would consider your project to be a failure.]
-


##Optional Features

##Project Schedule
[Make sure that you plan your work so that you can avoid a big rush right before the final project deadline, and delegate different modules and responsibilities among your team members. Write this in terms of weekly deadlines.]
