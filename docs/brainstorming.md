# File purpose: figure out what we're going to do for this project

## Project Categories (from class):
1. Use an existing technique and do it amazingly
    - WWII bar chart
2. A complex chart combining multiple types of visualization 
    - Flight data 
3. A new visualization technique 
4. A computationally-efficient algorithm for an existing technique 

## All Ideas (with descriptions)
Include description, places to look for data, and project category 

### GDP Doesn't Tell the Whole Story: Visualizing Economic and Social Well-being Country Data
#### Project Category: 
2
##### Description: 
I've always been frustrated with how GDP is used at almost the exclusion of other indicators of economic/social health. This is usually done because GDP is easy to understand and easy to talk about. It takes a long time for the average user to understand and compare other indicators. 

Similarly to how https://uvril.github.io/VisProject/# is done, create a series of visualizations to cover the various indicators of economic and social health.
#### Potential Data Sources: 
* https://datahub.io/collections/economic-data (IMF, World Bank data)
* https://www.econlib.org/library/sourcesUS.html - not actually a data source, but has a list of other data sources. 


### Visualizing High-Dimensional Data
#### Project Category: 
3
##### Description: 
Visualizing high-dimensional data is inherantly difficult. As the number of dimmensions increases, we get worse and worse at visualizing it. I've looked into some of the literature about it, and its pretty much an open research question. Parallel coordinates,  We could come up with some new way to visualize high-dimensional data for the project.

#### Potential Data Sources: 
It would depend on what visualization we selected
