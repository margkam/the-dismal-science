# Description of Proposal Sketches
The purpose of this file is to explain the sketches in the project proposal. 

## Ripple Chart
This chart is a central part of the recession visualization. In the actual visualization, each country will be color coded with its GDP Growth for the year selected on the slider at the bottom. Positive GDP Growth will be colored green. Negative GDP Growth will be colored red. The value of these colors is scaled by the degree to which GDP Growth is positive or negative. 

This chart will support multiple views. The primary views will be GDP Growth and Unemployment because these are the views most likely to show insight into how recessions spread and linger around the globe. Once those are implemented, we will explore whether other views offer useful insights. 

## Trade Interconnectedness Chart
Possibility - we're still undecided about this one. The goal would be to allow the user to see how the degree of global interconnectedness impacts the degree to which a financial crisis spreads between countries. The slider would be connected to the ripple chart slider so that both charts display the same year. 

The volume of trade between two countries would be shown using the the weight of the line connecting the two countries. We could also duplicate that encoding with the value of the line. To decrease clutter, countries will be grouped by continent and bundled accordingly.
